Currently I am a Postdoctoral research fellow in the [Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/genomics) at [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/). Broadly my research interest ranges from innovative methodology development in biomedical sciences, to solving challenges in data science and statistical learning in various applied domains. At Mount Sinai I am conducting research on integrative proteo-genomic analysis funded by [NCI-CPTAC](https://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptac) grant in the lab of [Dr. Pei Wang](http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/pei-wang-lab/people/). I am part of [PGDAC](https://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptac/consortium/cptac-teams) and primarily collaborate with [PTRC](https://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptac/consortium/cptac-teams) that focus on the proteo-genomic characterization of human tumors through community resources and aim to understand the molecular mechanism and identify signaling pathways driving the disease that, in turn, are translated into the clinic. Under the supervision of Dr. Pei Wang I have been focusing on integrative omics data analysis including normalization and imputation of proteomics data, differential gene expression and pathway enrichment analyses, gene regulatory network inference, among others, using sophisticated statistical models coupled with existing and newly developed bioinformatics tools. My primary research is focused on developing novel algorithms for learning directed networks integrating proteomics, genomics and single cell RNA-seq data.


I received my PhD degree in Applied Statistics from [University of California, Riverside](https://statistics.ucr.edu/). In my PhD dissertation I mainly focused on design of factorial experiments under the supervision of [Dr. Subir Ghosh](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/ghosh). 


Apart from the aforementioned experiences, other areas of Statistics/Biostatistics I am interested in include but not limited to: adaptive design, personalized medicine (dynamic treatment regime), Bayesian non-parametric modeling and high dimensional variable selection.
