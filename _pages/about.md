Currently I am a Postdoctoral research fellow in the [Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/genomics) at [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/). I am conducting research on integrative proteo-genomic analysis funded by [NCI-CPTAC](https://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptac) grant in the lab of [Dr. Pei Wang](http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/pei-wang-lab/people/). I am part of both [PGDAC and PTRC](https://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptac/consortium/cptac-teams) that focus on the proteo-genomic characterization of human tumors through community resources and aim to understand the molecular mechanism and identify signaling pathways driving the disease that, in turn, are translated into the clinic. Under the supervision of Dr. Pei Wang I have been focusing on integrative omics data analysis including 1) imputation of proteomics data 2) pathway enrichment analysis 3) gene regulatory network inference, among others. My current research is focused on developing novel algorithms for learning directed networks based on time-course proteomics data.


I received my PhD degree in Applied Statistics from [University of California, Riverside](https://statistics.ucr.edu/) in June 2016. In my PhD dissertation I mainly focused on design of factorial experiments under the supervision of [Dr. Subir Ghosh](https://statistics.ucr.edu/faculty/ghosh.html). After graduation, I joined  [Wayne State University School of Medicine](https://www.med.wayne.edu/) (Aug 2016 - March 2018) as a research fellow where my research was focused on developing novel statistical methodologies in clinical trials using Bayesian hierarchial modeling approach. 


Apart from the aforementioned experiences, other areas of Statistics/Biostatistics I am interested in include but not limited to: adaptive design including SMART designs, personalized medicine (dynamic treatment regime), Bayesian non-parametric modeling and high dimensional variable selection.
