Currently I am a research fellow in the [Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/genomics) at [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/). I am conducting research on integrative proteogenomics analysis funded by [NCI-CPTAC grant](https://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptac) in the lab of Dr. Pei Wang. I am part of both [PGDAC and PTRC](https://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptac/consortium/cptac-teams) that focuses on the proteogenomic characterization of human tumors through community resources and aims to understand the molecular mechanism and identify signaling pathways driving the disease that, in turn, are translated into the clinic. Two major areas my research focuses on are imputation of omics data using iterative prediction model and gene regulatory network learning for proteomics data using probabilistic graphical models, among others.


I received my PhD degree in Applied Statistics from [University of California, Riverside](https://statistics.ucr.edu/) in June 2016. In my PhD dissertation I mainly focused on design of factorial experiments. After graduation, I joined [Wayne State University School of Medicine](https://www.med.wayne.edu/) as a PostDoc fellow when my research was focused on developing novel statistical methodologies in clinical trials using Bayesian hierarchial modeling approach. Other areas of Statistics/Biostatistics I am interested in include but not limited to: adaptive design including SMART  designs, personalized medicine (dynamic treatment regime), Bayesian non parametric modeling and high dimensional variable selection for zero inflated outcome models.
