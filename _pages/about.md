Currently I am a research fellow in the Department Genetics and Genomic Sciences at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. I am conducting research on integrative proteogenomics analysis funded by [NCI-CPTAC grant](https://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptac) in the lab of Dr. Pei Wang. Im am part of both [PGDAC and PTRC (https://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptac/consortium/cptac-teams). Primarily my research focuses on imputation of omics data using iterative prediction model and network analysis for proteomics data using probabilistic graphical models.


My research interest lies broadly in developing novel statistical methodologies with application in biomedical sciences. Currently  Other areas of Statistics/Biostatistics I am interested in include but not limited to: adaptive design including SMART  designs, personalized medicine (dynamic treatment regime), Bayesian non parametric modeling and high dimensional variable selection for zero inflated outcome models.
