Education is one of the basic necessities that eradicates poverty and promotes equity in a society. Yet in India, an aspiring country to be a global superpower, only 8% of the relevant age group can afford undergraduate education and above, largely due to financial constraints. [Padakshep](https://padakshep.org) (meaning small step) is a non profit organization formed and powered by a group of similar minded people across the globe who believe in the role of education in shaping a society. Our primary goal is to provide basic educational guidance to a group of bright yet financially underprivileged students carefully selected through a rigorous screening process. We carry out several initiatives to reach out to a wide spectrum of needy students to provide funding, teaching and books, and provide other necessities to help them fulfilling their dreams and shaping their future. 

I currently hold the position of treasurer and am a member of the [board of directors](http://padakshep.org/about/people/) at Padakshep.
